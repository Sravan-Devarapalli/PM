Database upgrade has failed if you see this message. This might be lack of MSI installation permissions. 
Try to run installation manually.

To run it manually:
1. Run CMD
2. Type the following:
	updatedb.bat <servername> <databasename> "<setup folder path>"
		<servername> - database server name
		<databasename> - database name, the one that will be upgraded
		<setup folder path> - path to the setup folder (without trailing slash)

Example: 
	updatedb.bat (local) pm_jun_30 d:\PRMA\Trash\Setup
		(local) - server name
		pm_jun_30 - database name
		d:\PRMA\Trash\Setup - folder MSI was installed to
